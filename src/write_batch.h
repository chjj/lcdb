/* Batch holds a collection of updates to apply atomically to a DB.
 *
 * The updates are applied in the order in which they are added
 * to the batch. For example, the value of "key" will be "v3"
 * after the following batch is written:
 *
 *    ldb_batch_put(batch, "key", "v1");
 *    ldb_batch_del(batch, "key");
 *    ldb_batch_put(batch, "key", "v2");
 *    ldb_batch_put(batch, "key", "v3");
 *
 * Multiple threads can invoke const methods on a batch without
 * external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
 * non-const method, all threads accessing the same batch must use
 * external synchronization.
